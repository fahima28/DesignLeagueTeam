 <h1>Name and Role:</h1>
  <p>
    My name is Brithany Sanchez And I am the time manager for this team. I am responsible for managing the time we have left for the codes.</p>

  <h1>Why is this subject important to you?</h1>

  <p>This subject is important to me because it is something I would like people to learn and make our enviorment better. This would be for the people to stop littering and throwing trash in the street and stop harming our enviorment. If the trash is not recycled it will end up in the ocean and the animals will die. So this type of game can help the young people to learn how to recycle and how to help the enviorment.</p>

  <h1>What do you do for your team?</h1>
  
  <p>What I do for my team is to check the time and help code and organize something that are needed for the team to finish the project.</p>
